    "6. kNN, Isolation Forest, One-class SVM, Random Forest. Predict the crime rate for a zip-code/block based on socioeconomic factors. Split into a training vs test set (80/20). See which ones have the lowest MSE. (**Ethan** for Random Forest, Isolation Forest) (**Calvin** for kNN and One-class SVM)\n",
